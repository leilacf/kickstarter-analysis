# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## 1. Overview of Project
   ### 1a. Purpose
   For this project, Louise required an analysis and visualization of varying campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals, to understand the reasoning behind those which succeeded and failed. In doing so, the purpose of this analysis was to distinguish patterns or trends in these campaigns, to better guide Louise in her own ventures. 

## 2. Analysis and Challenges

### 2a. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

   In the above line chart, one can see that May (111) and June (100) had the highest peaks of "succesful theatre campaigns" before hitting a rapid and continuous downward slope with a reducing success rate, during all of the years documented. This could indicate that the months towards end of spring and begining of summer are the best to launch a campaign. There was also a relatively low failure rate during this time as in May only 31% of campaigns failed on average while 68% of campaigns succeeded. Simimarly in June, there was a 32% failure rate with a 65% success rate. This can be compared with one of the lowest months of succesful campaigns, December. Campaigns launched in Decemeber, had a 46% failure rate and 49% success rate, however this month had the lowest amount launched--demonstarting that the winter/holiday time could be quite a rocky and unstable time to launch a campaign as historically based on this data, there seems to be a close split between failure and success. Therefore, based on this data visualization, one can conclude that all months contain risks and external variables that can affect the success rate of a campaign, but certain months such as May and June could prove to be more favorable months for a launch. 
          

### 2b. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

   The line chart above analyzes the success and failure rate of campaigns based on their goal amount for production in USD. One can see how for the ranges of "less than 1000, 1000-4999, 5000-9999, and 10000-14999" there was a higher percentage of successful campaigns than there was for failed ones. The range of "1000-4999" had the most campaigns (534) demonstrating that many individuals might believe that this range is an attainable and feasible goal, in comparison to other ranges. The range of "15000-19999" has a success and failure rate of %50, which this may be due to the fact that this approachs a larger goal, closer to $20,000. Lastly, the ranges from "20000-24999" until "greater than 50000" mostly have higher failure rates than success rates, and have fewer campaigns falling into those goal categories. This data is very useful in demonstarting to indivduals like Louise, which ranges are more attainable and lead to higher chances of success rather than failure as it provides concrete parameters for the goals of these projects.

### 2c. Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## 3. Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
